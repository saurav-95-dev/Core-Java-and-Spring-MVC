//Wrapper class :
//NOTES:
//For every primitive type we have class for it and that class extends the object class.
//Difference b/w primitive type and wrapper class :
//1-> Primitive types are not objects and hence lack OOPS features like methods and fields.
//2-> Primitive types cannot be assigned null values . They need to have some default values whereas wrapper class being objects , can hold null values.
//3-> Primitive types are generally more efficient where wrapper class are not due to object overhead.
//4-> Primitive types values can be changes directly , whereas instances of wrapper classes are generally immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed after creation. A new object is created for modifications.
