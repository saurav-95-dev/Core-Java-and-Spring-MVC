//Concept of classes and objects:
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Building Foundation in java");;
    }
}
//Takeaways:
//In java , in order to create an object , you first have to create a class.
//Java Byte code is platform independent and can run on any OS that has JRE.
//JRE has a software component called JVM that converts java byte code into native code for the unline OS.
//We create a blueprint by creating a class which turns into bytecode . This bytecode pass into JVM from where
// we get our object.
