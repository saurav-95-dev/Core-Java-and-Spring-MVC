////Java Collection :
//Core concepts and framework basics
//Java Collections Framework: Understand what the framework is and its key benefits, such as a consistent API, reduced development effort, and increased speed and quality.
//Collection vs. Collections: Know the crucial difference between the Collection interface (the root of the hierarchy) and the Collections utility class, which provides static methods for operating on collections.
//Collection hierarchy: Be able to explain the structure of the Collection framework, including the main interfaces (List, Set, Queue, and Map) and their relationship to implementing classes.
//Array vs. Collection: Differentiate between the two, noting that arrays have a fixed size and can store primitives, while collections are dynamic and only store objects.

//Key implementation classes
//ArrayList vs. LinkedList: Compare these two List implementations:
//Data structure: ArrayList uses a dynamic array; LinkedList uses a doubly-linked list.
//Performance: ArrayList offers faster random access (reading), while LinkedList provides faster insertion and deletion.
//Use case: Choose ArrayList for read-heavy operations and LinkedList for applications with frequent data manipulation.
