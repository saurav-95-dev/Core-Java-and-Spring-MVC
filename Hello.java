//Throw/throws keyword:
//throw keyword is used to throw the exception for the catch block to catch it .
//If we are doing a valid arithmetic for example , catch block won't get executed .
//Here we want to catch block to be executed for even a valid arithmetic operation , for that purpose we can use throw.
//**throwing self created custom exception.
