//IMPORTANT:

//ðŸ‘‰ Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:
//        new Computer() { ... };
//This does NOT mean we are directly creating an object of Computer.
//Instead, we are creating an anonymous class (a class without a name) that extends Computer and provides an implementation for its abstract method func1().
//Java immediately creates an object of that anonymous subclass and assigns it to the reference c.
